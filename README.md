# Capital.js [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/CapitalJS/capitaljs.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/CapitalJS/capitaljs)

## Installation

In a browser:

```
<script src="capital.js"></script>
```

Using npm:

```
$ npm install capitaljs
```

## Usage

In a browser:

```
var rate = capitaljs.compoundAnnualGrowthRate({...});
```

In an AMD loader:

```
require(['capitaljs'], function(capitaljs) {...});
```

In Node:

```
var capitaljs = require('capitaljs');
var rate = capitaljs.compoundAnnualGrowthRate({...});
```

Or if you just want a single formula (to reduce your browser bundle's filesize):

```
var cagr = require('capitaljs/compoundAnnualGrowthRate');
var rate = cagr({...});
```

## Current formulae:
